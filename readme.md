# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN and Streamlit

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a **Customer Churn Prediction System** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.  
The model is trained on a churn dataset to predict whether a customer will **stay with the company or leave (churn)**.

The project consists of three major components:

1. **Model Training**
   - Data preprocessing, feature encoding, and scaling.
   - ANN model creation and training using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Trained model is saved for reuse.

2. **Model Prediction**
   - The saved ANN model is loaded.
   - New customer data is passed as input.
   - The model predicts customer churn status.

3. **Visualization and Deployment**
   - A web application is built using Streamlit.
   - Users can input customer details interactively.
   - Prediction results are displayed instantly.
   - Enables easy testing and visualization of model predictions.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from model development to deployment.
